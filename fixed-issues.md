# Fixed Issues in Next.js Application

## 1. Syntax Errors in layout.js

**Issue**: 
- `Uncaught SyntaxError: "" literal not terminated before end of script layout.js:527:2657517`
- This was caused by a broken `</div>` tag in the Suspense fallback component that was split across multiple lines

**Fix**:
- Rewrote the `app/layout.tsx` file with proper formatting
- Ensured all HTML tags were properly closed and not split across lines

## 2. Chunk Loading Errors

**Issue**:
- `Uncaught ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk app/layout failed.`
- This was caused by malformed JavaScript that couldn't be parsed properly

**Fix**:
- Fixed syntax errors in layout files
- Cleaned up the .next directory to force a fresh build
- Resolved UTF-8 encoding issues with Arabic text

## 3. Client Component Issues

**Issue**:
- Corrupted first line in ClientLayout.tsx with embedded text
- Improperly formatted Arabic text in ErrorBoundary component

**Fix**:
- Rewrote ClientLayout.tsx with proper 'use client' directive
- Fixed Arabic text encoding in ErrorBoundary.tsx

## 4. NextAuth Configuration

**Issue**:
- JWT decryption errors appearing in the console

**Fix**:
- Explicitly set NEXTAUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_URL environment variables
- Added DEBUG environment variable to get more information

## 5. Environment Variables

**Issue**:
- Inconsistent environment variables causing authentication issues

**Fix**:
- Explicitly set all required environment variables:
  - SKIP_PRISMA_GENERATE='true'
  - NEXTAUTH_URL='http://localhost:3000'
  - NEXTAUTH_SECRET='this_is_a_secure_secret_key_for_development_do_not_use_in_production'
  - DEBUG='next-auth:*'

## Results

- Server successfully running on port 3000
- Page loads without syntax errors
- No more chunk loading errors
- Fixed Arabic text display in error messages
